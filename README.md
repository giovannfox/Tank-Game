The project was made using Intellij IDE with java version "1.8.0_201"

To run the game
First git clone using git bash or something similar
to clone the repo onto your computer
Then use IntelliJ and import the repository 
Set the current directory to use java and be the root of the project
Build and run the Program
I believe I have a older version of java
so the new versions should work fine

Of course this is only needed in case the JAR
I have supplied does not work.
If the JAR works simply download the JAR and enjoy!

When making the JAR some errors occured and my sound doesn't work anymore, 
also when you shoot once it stops the game,
not sure why this happened but the game was running perfectly fine before I 
made the Jar.
